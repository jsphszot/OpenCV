# OpenCV - img to df

Uses google Tesseract and OpenCV to extract <i>Part XV Line 3</i> tables data from IRS form 990 files saved as image pdfs.<br>
TableFormat.pdf is an example of the format in which PartXV info is displayed (other formats may exist, but this is the generic format I've seen in the forms).<br>
PDF-inputs folder includes a couple of pdfs to be read and looped over.<br>
